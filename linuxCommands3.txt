> When application running, it will generate log messages and it will store log messages at bottom of the file.


-> To see log messages of the application we will use 'tail' command


cp command
---------
-> To copy the data from one file to another file

	$ cp one.txt two.txt  ( or ) $ cat one.txt > two.txt

	$ cp f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt  (invalid syntax)

-> We can't copy morethan one file data using 'cp' command. To copy multiple files data we should go for 'cat' command

	$ cat f1.txt f2.txt > f3.txt

Rename the files or directories
--------------------------------
-> To rename files we will use 'mv' command

	$ mv f1.txt f1111.txt

	$ mv  dirname dirnewname

Note: We can use 'mv' command for renaming and moving files

Comparing files
---------------
-> To compare files we can use below commands

$ cmp f1.txt f2.txt
$ diff f1.txt f2.txt

-> cmp command will display only first difference in given 2 two files
-> diff command will display all the differences in the content

grep command
------------
-> 'grep' stands for global regular expression print.

-> 'grep' command will process the text line by line and prints any lines which matches given pattern.

	Ex: I want to print all lines which contains 'NullPointerException'

	$ grep -i 'NullPointerException' *

Note: We can install grep using below command

	$ sudo yum install grep

//search for the lines which contains given word in the given filename
$ grep 'word' filename

//search for the lines which are having exception keyword in server.log file
$ grep -i 'exception' server.log 

//search for the given text in present directory and in sub-directories also
$ grep -R 'exception'

=> We can pass several options for 'grep' command

-c : This prints only the count of files that matches give pattern

-i : ignore case-sentitivty

-n : Display the matched lines and their line numbers

-l : Displays only file names that matches the pattern

-h : Displays matched lines without file names

-R : Displays matched lines with file names
