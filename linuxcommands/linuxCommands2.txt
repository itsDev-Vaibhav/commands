=> 'ls' is used to list out all files & directories available in the given directory

Note: we can pass several options for 'ls' commands

-> ls : It will display all files in alphabetical order (a to z)

-> ls -r : It will display all files in reverse of alphabetical order (z to a)

-> ls -l : It will display long listing of files

-> ls -t : It will display all files based on last modified date and time. Most recent file will be display at top and old files will display at bottom.

-> ls -rt : It will display all files based on reverse of last modified date and time. Old files will display at top and recent files will display bottom.


-> ls -a : It will display all files including hidden files (hidden files will start with .)

-> ls -li : It will display files with inode.

-> ls -lR : It will display all files and directories along with sub directoris content

	Note: -R represents recursive

Note:  We can use several options for ls command at a time. When we are using multiple options order of the options is not important

		$ ls -ltr
		$ ls -tlr
		$ ls -l -t -r
		$ ls -trl

Note: All the above commands will give same output


-> To display content of given directory we can execute like below

		$ rmdir dirname

-> To delete non-empty directory we will use 'rm' command like below

		$ rm -r dirname


-> To display file content we will use 'cat' command

		$ cat filename

-> To display file content with line numbers we will use '-n' option

		$ cat -n filename


-> To display multiple files content at a time execute command like below
